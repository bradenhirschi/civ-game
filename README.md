**For now this is where I'll keep issues and next steps**

Important recently completed things:
- Gave player class access to units created for them

Next important steps:
- Implement movement of units. This will probably be easiest with a simple onclick method on the unit and then on a tile. I need to figure out where in state the units and their locations are stored
